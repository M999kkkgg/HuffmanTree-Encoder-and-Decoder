# Huffman Tree Encoder and Decoder
## Description
This is a Huffman tree project based on the course design of data structure. It can compress an English text through Huffman coding, and then decompress the compressed file. After testing, the compression rate is maintained at about 60% to 75%, and the decompression reduction rate is maintained at more than 99%. 

### Here are some **tips** before using it.
> 1. Using **C** language and **C++** language
> 2. Using **Visual C++ (6.0)** as IDE
> 3. Click **Debug/HuffmanTree encoder and decoder.exe** to run the program
> 4. The specific steps are shown on pages **6** to **16** of the file named **Report.pdf**.
> 5. The folder named **Debug** contains executable programs(*.exe), and you can run the program in it(as shown in Tip 3).
> 6. The folder named **Scripts** contains CPP, C files and header files.
> 7. Other documents are VC++6.0 engineering documents(like *.dsp or *.dsw).

## What you need to know before you start
### Encoder
> ***Input***
> + The file named **Text.txt** that you want to compress.

> ***Output***
> + Code.txt: Huffman code corresponding to each character.
> + Encoded.txt: The visual binary file of the source file after Huffman coding.
> + EncodedText.huf: Huffman compressed file.
### Decoder
> ***Input***
> + Code.txt
> + Encoded.txt
> + EncodedText.huf

> ***Output***
> + Decoded.txt: Decompressed file.
